## üîí Deploying as a Tor Hidden Service (Onion Site)

For maximum privacy and security, you can deploy this chat application as a Tor hidden service, making it accessible only through the Tor network.

### Why Use Tor?

- **Enhanced Privacy**: Communication remains within the Tor network
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Extra layer of protection beyond the app's built-in security
- **Circumvention of Censorship**: Bypass network restrictions and censorship
- **Hidden Location**: Server's physical location remains concealed

### Setup Instructions

1. Install Tor on your server:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install tor
   ```

2. Configure Tor as a hidden service:
   
   Edit the Tor configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
   ```
   
   Add the following lines:
   ```
   HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/chat_service/
   HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:3001
   HiddenServicePort 5173 127.0.0.1:5173
   ```

3. Restart Tor:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart tor
   ```

4. Get your .onion address:
   ```bash
   sudo cat /var/lib/tor/chat_service/hostname
   ```

5. Update your client to use WebSocket connections compatible with Tor:
   
   In your client's `constants.ts` file:
   ```typescript
   export const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://youronionaddress.onion';
   export const SOCKET_URL = API_URL;
   ```

6. Configure your server to listen only on localhost:
   
   In your server's `.env` file:
   ```
   HOST=127.0.0.1
   PORT=3001
   ```

7. Run your application servers and access through the Tor Browser at:
   ```
   http://youronionaddress.onion
   ```

### Security Considerations for Tor Deployment

- Use HTTPS for connections when possible
- Enable strict CORS policies
- Implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks
- Regular security audits are essential
- Consider using a dedicated server for your Tor hidden service

## üì± Mobile Compatibility

The application is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop browsers
- Mobile browsers
- Can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA)
